# Proposal Experiments #

This description is meant to list two types of experiments we will perform on our web server. In addition, we will explan the reason.

### Experiments ###

* Apache web server performance evaluation on different AWS instance types
* MySQL Performance evaluation on different AWS instance types

### Reasons ###

* For the first experiment, it is important for us to know the performance of Apache Web Server since it matters to find the system breaks and try to avoid them. Thus, it has practical meaning. 
* For the second experiment, since we already decided that we will use Mysql database, it will be better if we know how well it performs, like how fast it takes to query records from database.
