# HiAir - book airline tickets (React) (100 points)
In this creative project, we’ll design a website for airline reservation in the U.S, which means we might only provide limited cities for routes due to limited data. Specifically, we are going to implement React JS lib and bootstrap for css. Besides, we do need stripe for react to implement  payment function.
